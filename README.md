FigmaProject

FigmaProject is a project that aims to explore the idea of Backend-driven UI by parsing Figma's API and constructing a view using only iOS native elements. Currently, the project allows you to create vectors (any shapes, lines, ellipses, etc.), frames, and simple text. However, note that you cannot yet set up line spacing, alignment, or other text settings.

Getting Started

To get started with FigmaProject, you'll need to have access to Figma's API and an iOS development environment. Here are the steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Set up your Figma API credentials by following the instructions in the API.md file.
Open the Xcode project and run the app on a simulator or device.
Usage

Once you have the app running, you can use it to create vectors, frames, and simple text. Here's how:

Open the app and log in with your Figma account.
Choose a Figma file to work with.
Select a vector or frame in the file and tap the "Add" button to add it to your iOS view.
For text, simply type in the text you want to display and tap "Add".
To move an element, tap and hold it, then drag it to the desired location.
Future Implementation

In the future, the FigmaProject team plans to add support for any text, photos, and drag and move functionality. Stay tuned for updates!

# FigmaProject

FigmaProject is an idea about Backend-driven UI. The first step to make it - parse Figma API and try to construct view using only iOS native elements. For that moment you can create:

1. Vector (Any shapes, Lines, Ellipses, and etc.)
2. Frames
3. Very simple text. For now, you cannot set up line spacing, alignment, and other settings.

## Getting Started

To get started with FigmaProject, you'll need to have access to Figma's API and an iOS development environment. Here are the steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Xcode project and run the app on a simulator or device.

## Usage

Once you have the app running, you can use it to create vectors, frames, and simple text. Here's how:

1. Open the app and log in with your Figma account.
2. Choose a Figma file to work with.
3. Modify Figma file as you want.

## Future Implementation

1. Support any text
2. Support any Photos
3. Support drag and move
